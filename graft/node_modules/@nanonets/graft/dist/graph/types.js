/**
 * `graph.json` — the code graph schema (v1).
 *
 * One node per definition (file, class, function, method, interface, type, enum),
 * wired by edges (contains, imports, calls, ...). Field names follow the LSP
 * vocabulary (`name`, `kind`, ...) rather than any one tool's conventions.
 *
 * Two tiers of data live on a node:
 *   - Tier-1 (deterministic, $0): everything from the AST. Rebuilt on every run.
 *   - Tier-2 (one LLM call, cached on `body_hash`): `summary` + `crux`.
 * M1 populates Tier-1 only; Tier-2 fields ship as `pending`/null.
