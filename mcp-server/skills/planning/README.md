# Planning

**Planning** is an MCP skill available in the `pai-stack`.

Persistent file-based planning for multi-step tasks. Keeps task_plan.md, findings.md, and progress.md on disk so plans survive context loss, session restarts, and crashes. Use for any task with 3+ steps, research, or multi-file changes.

## How to Use (For Humans & Agents)

### For Agents
When interacting with the repository, this skill will be automatically loaded or fetched if the context calls for it. The agent is strictly bound by the rules and workflows defined in the `SKILL.md` file.

### For Developers
You can explicitly trigger this skill by prompting your agent (e.g., Hermes, Claude Code, Antigravity) to use it. This forces the agent to read the structured instructions and adhere to your project's standardized workflows, preventing hallucinations.

**Example Prompt:**
> "Use the `planning` skill to help me with..."

## Technical Details
This skill is parsed and served by the `pai-stack` MCP server. The operational logic, ground rules, and system prompt payloads reside in `SKILL.md`, which is mapped to `skill://planning` for headless agents to fetch.
