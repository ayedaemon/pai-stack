Load whenever producing or updating a Mermaid diagram: picks the correct type, layout direction, abstraction level, layout engine, and applies syntax safety rules and readability caps. Covers flowchart, sequence, class, ER, state, C4, gitgraph, mindmap, gantt, quadrant, timeline, and more."

# Mermaid

> Load this skill before writing ANY Mermaid diagram. Your three jobs:
> 1. Pick the right **type** for the intent.
> 2. Set the right **depth** (abstraction level) — never mix levels.
> 3. Produce **safe, readable syntax** — quote labels, avoid reserved words, respect size caps.

---

## Step 1 — Type Selection

Match the user's intent to a diagram type. Use the first match.

```
What is the primary question the diagram answers?
│
├── "What order do things happen in?" / "How do services talk?"
│   └── sequenceDiagram
│
├── "What are the decision paths / steps in a process?"
│   └── flowchart TD   (or LR for horizontal pipelines)
│
├── "What is the high-level system architecture / infra topology?"
│   └── flowchart LR   (stable, use over architecture-beta)
│
├── "How are services / containers organised in this system?"
│   └── flowchart LR   (C4 Container level, label each node with its type)
│
├── "What is the database schema / table relationships?"
│   └── erDiagram
│
├── "What are the classes / types and their relationships?"
│   └── classDiagram
│
├── "What are the states and transitions?"
│   └── stateDiagram-v2
│
├── "What is the git branching strategy?"
│   └── gitGraph
│
├── "What are the concepts / topics / features?" (brainstorm map)
│   └── mindmap
│
├── "What is the project schedule / phases?"
│   └── gantt
│
├── "How should items be prioritised?" (2×2 matrix)
│   └── quadrantChart
│
├── "What is the timeline of events?"
│   └── timeline
│
├── "How do flow volumes relate?" (Sankey / proportional)
│   └── sankey-beta
│
└── "What proportion of the whole?" (single metric)
    └── pie
```

**Tiebreaker rules:**
- Structural ("what exists") → `classDiagram` or `flowchart LR`
- Behavioral ("what happens") → `sequenceDiagram` or `flowchart TD`
- When in doubt between flowchart and sequence: if time/ordering is the core message → sequence; if branching logic is → flowchart.

---

## Step 2 — Abstraction Level (C4 Protocol)

**Rule: pick one level and stay there. Never mix.**

| Level | What to show | Node examples | Diagram type |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 System Context | Your system + external users + external systems | `User`, `YourApp`, `Stripe`, `SendGrid` | `flowchart LR` or `C4Context` |
| L2 Container | Services, databases, queues, frontends inside your system | `API Gateway`, `Postgres`, `Redis`, `React App` | `flowchart LR` |
| L3 Component | Modules/packages inside one service | `AuthModule`, `OrderService`, `PaymentProcessor` | `flowchart LR` or `classDiagram` |
| L4 Code | Classes, interfaces, their methods | `class User`, `+login()`, `+logout()` | `classDiagram` only |

**Detecting the right level:**
- User asks "how does the system work overall" → L1
- User asks "what services / containers / databases are there" → L2
- User asks "what's inside service X" → L3
- User asks "show the class structure" → L4

**Violation example:**
```mermaid
%% ❌ WRONG — mixes L1 actor with L3 internal module
flowchart LR
    User --> APIGateway
    APIGateway --> AuthModule
    AuthModule --> verifyToken["verifyToken()"]
```

```mermaid
%% ✅ RIGHT — L2 container diagram: stops at service boundaries
flowchart LR
    User["👤 User"] --> GW["API Gateway\n(Node.js)"]
    GW --> AuthSvc["Auth Service\n(Python)"]
    GW --> DB[("Postgres")]
    AuthSvc --> Cache[("Redis")]
```

---

## Step 3 — Layout Direction & Engine

### Direction (flowchart / graph)

| Direction | Use when |
|---|---|
| `TD` (top-down) | Decision trees, process flows, CI/CD steps, state transitions shown as flow |
| `LR` (left-right) | Pipelines, data flows, system architecture, horizontal timelines of services |
| `BT` (bottom-up) | Rarely useful — avoid unless user asks |
| `RL` (right-left) | Avoid |

**Default**: use `TD` for process/decision, `LR` for architecture/data-flow.

### Layout engine (YAML config frontmatter)

Add a config block at the top of the diagram when the default isn't right:

```mermaid
---
config:
  layout: elk
---
flowchart LR
    A --> B --> C
```

| Engine | When to use |
|---|---|
| `elk` | Complex diagrams with many edges, deeply nested subgraphs, want orthogonal routing. **Default in v12+.** |
| `dagre` | Simple flowcharts, fast rendering, legacy compatibility. Use if elk produces ugly overlaps on small graphs. |
| `cose-bilkent` | Force-directed graphs where edge crossing minimisation matters more than orthogonal paths. |
| `tidy-tree` | Strict trees with no cycles (org charts, taxonomies). |

**Decision:** ≤ 10 nodes → `dagre`; 11–30 nodes → `elk` (default); > 30 nodes → split the diagram first, then elk.

---

## Step 4 — Syntax Safety Rules

### 4.1 Quote labels that contain special characters

Any label with `()`, `:`, `,`, `/`, `-`, `&`, `<`, `>`, `.`, `'` must be wrapped in double quotes.

```mermaid
%% ❌ WRONG — unquoted special chars break the parser
flowchart TD
    A(Process (v2.0): Start) --> B[Check: is user valid?]
```

```mermaid
%% ✅ CORRECT
flowchart TD
    A["Process (v2.0): Start"] --> B["Check: is user valid?"]
```

### 4.2 Never use `end` as a node ID

`end` closes subgraphs and loop blocks — it is a reserved keyword.

```mermaid
%% ❌ WRONG
flowchart TD
    start --> process --> end
```

```mermaid
%% ✅ CORRECT
flowchart TD
    S[Start] --> P[Process] --> FIN[End]
```

### 4.3 Keep node IDs short and alphanumeric

Node IDs are internal references. Labels are what gets displayed.

```mermaid
%% ❌ WRONG — hyphen in ID, breaks some parsers
flowchart LR
    api-gateway --> auth-service
```

```mermaid
%% ✅ CORRECT — clean IDs, human-readable labels
flowchart LR
    gw["API Gateway"] --> auth["Auth Service"]
```

### 4.4 HTML entities for characters that break parser inside quotes

| Character | Entity |
|---|---|
| `"` | `#quot;` |
| `;` | `#59;` |
| `&` | `#amp;` |
| `<` | `#lt;` |
| `>` | `#gt;` |

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["price #gt; 100 #amp;#amp; stock #gt; 0"] --> B[Apply discount]
```

### 4.5 Subgraph labels must be quoted if they contain spaces

```mermaid
%% ❌ WRONG
subgraph Auth Module
```

```mermaid
%% ✅ CORRECT
subgraph authmod["Auth Module"]
```

### 4.6 Sequence diagram participant names with spaces

```mermaid
%% ❌ WRONG
sequenceDiagram
    API Gateway->>Auth Service: POST /token
```

```mermaid
%% ✅ CORRECT — use participant aliases
sequenceDiagram
    participant GW as API Gateway
    participant AUTH as Auth Service
    GW->>AUTH: POST /token
```

---

## Step 5 — Readability Caps

**When a diagram exceeds these limits, split it — do not squeeze.**

| Diagram type | Node / participant limit | Message / edge limit | Split strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `flowchart` | 20 nodes | 25 edges | Split by subgraph / layer; one diagram per C4 level |
| `sequenceDiagram` | 6 participants | 20 messages | Split by use case or feature boundary |
| `classDiagram` | 12 classes | — | Split by package / module |
| `erDiagram` | 10 entities | — | Split by domain aggregate |
| `stateDiagram-v2` | 15 states | — | Split by sub-state region |
| `mindmap` | depth ≤ 3 | — | Flatten or promote sub-topics to their own mindmap |

**Splitting pattern for flowcharts:**
```
docs/
  architecture.md          ← L1 System Context (the overview)
  architecture-containers.md  ← L2 Container map
  architecture-<service>.md   ← L3 Component detail per service
```

---

## Step 6 — File Placement

| Scenario | Where to write / update |
|---|---|
| Project-level architecture update | `<EXECUTION_DIR>/docs/architecture.md` (required by AGENTS.md) |
| New C4 level for an existing system | New file: `docs/architecture-<level>.md` (e.g. `architecture-containers.md`) |
| Module / service internal diagram | `<EXECUTION_DIR>/docs/<service-name>.md` |
| ADR-embedded diagram | Inline in `<EXECUTION_DIR>/.planning/research/ADR-XXX.md` |
| Scratch / draft diagram | `<EXECUTION_DIR>/.planning/<date-slug>/diagram-draft.md` |

**Rule:** never create a new file without first checking whether an existing file already contains a diagram for the same scope. Grep for `mermaid` under `docs/` and `<EXECUTION_DIR>/.planning/` first.

---

## Step 7 — Validation Checklist (run before outputting)

Before producing the final diagram, check every item:

- [ ] **Type match** — diagram type matches the user's intent (re-read Step 1)
- [ ] **Single abstraction level** — no mixing of L1/L2/L3/L4 nodes in one diagram
- [ ] **Labels quoted** — every label with `()`, `:`, `,`, `/`, `-` is wrapped in `"..."`
- [ ] **No `end` node IDs** — replaced with `FIN`, `done`, `END`, etc.
- [ ] **Node IDs alphanumeric** — no hyphens, dots, spaces in IDs
- [ ] **Size within cap** — node/participant/entity count is within the limit for this type
- [ ] **Layout engine set** — config frontmatter present if non-default engine needed
- [ ] **Direction chosen** — `TD` for process/decision, `LR` for architecture/pipeline
- [ ] **Subgraph labels quoted** — every `subgraph` with a space in the label uses `["..."]`
- [ ] **Sequence aliases** — multi-word participants use `participant X as Long Name`
- [ ] **File target identified** — know which file this goes into before outputting

## Anti-patterns (summary)

| Anti-pattern | Why it's wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Using `graph TD` instead of `flowchart TD` | `graph` is deprecated syntax | Always use `flowchart` |
| Unquoted labels with `(` or `:` | Parser breaks silently | Quote the label |
| 40-node flowchart | Unreadable, defeats the purpose | Split into sub-diagrams |
| Mixing system actors with internal classes | Violates abstraction level — audience can't reason about it | Pick one C4 level |
| `end` as node ID | Reserved keyword | Use `FIN` or `done` |
| Forgetting `participant` aliases in sequence diagrams | Multi-word names break arrow syntax | Always declare participants |
